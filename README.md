-  Implement Inverse Iteration without built-in eigenvalue calculators or solvers to determine the eigenvalue of a given matrix, displaying eigenvector values and the norm of yk at each iteration.
-  Implement Rayleigh-Quotient Iteration with Shifts without built-in eigenvalue calculators or solvers to determine the eigenvalue of the same matrix, displaying eigenvector values and the Rayleigh-Quotient at each iteration.
